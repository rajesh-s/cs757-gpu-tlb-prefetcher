Agenda:

-	Narrow down 1-2 topics for the 3-paper summary due on Oct 5. This will serve as the literature survey too and hopefully we can all take up unique papers to save time and present the findings to the others
-	Try to scroll through the recent program of any of the conferences listed here to find topics of relevance to 757: https://github.com/rajesh-s/computer-engineering-resources#computer-architecture--systems
We will also do this during the meeting
